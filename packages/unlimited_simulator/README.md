# `package:unlimited_simulator`

A simulator-engine for the [Star Wars: Unlimited][swu] CCG.

[swu]: https://starwarsunlimited.com/

This package contains a local in-memory simulator for Star Wars: Unlimited.
While intended to be possible to run on different platforms (i.e. browser,
server, or mobile), the actual libraries are platform agnostic and can be used
anywhere Dart is supported.
